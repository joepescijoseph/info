Implement design patterns in .NET using the latest versions of the C# and F# languages. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the field of design patterns as they are used in today’s developer toolbox.

Using the C# programming language, Design Patterns in .NET explores the classic design pattern implementation and discusses the applicability and relevance of specific language features for the purpose of implementing patterns. You will learn by example, reviewing scenarios where patterns are applicable. MVP and patterns expert Dmitri Nesteruk demonstrates possible implementations of patterns, discusses alternatives and pattern inter-relationships, and illustrates the way that a dedicated refactoring tool (ReSharper) can be used to implement design patterns with ease.
